	about this site:

this installation is like my tenth fourteenth twenty-first twenty-fifth attempt to organize my stuff, including blogs, howtos, todos, contacts, essays, tales, collected quotes and trivia, and some original content including technical stuff, noise and visual content. I also have a ton of backend stuff I use that you don't care about that was hard to get all working together and that evolves over time. I don't know what to tell you about the stacks of paper journals and shoeboxes full of audio tapes and other media.

it's a thing.
