        <div class="article-content markdown-body"><p>What do I believe?</p>
<p>First of all I don’t know.<br />
But I have a feeling.</p>
<p>I don’t have an answer to the problem of evil, why bad things happen to good people.<br />
And I don’t know what happens when we die. where we go, if anywhere, not to mention where we come from or how!</p>
<p>But I have a feeling that there’s more to life than it sometimes seems and we’re all a part of something bigger.<br />
Much bigger.<br />
So big you have no idea how big and surprising and amazing reality is.</p>
<p>And it’s humbling when you think about it.</p>
<p>We are fearfully, wonderfully made.</p>
<p>And I believe there is something useful in the scriptures of the ancients</p>
<p>But it would be foolish not to approach them critically.  Rather we should try to understand them in their context and each with its own unique voice and message.</p>
<p>Some is pure nonsense, and some is precious wisdom and consolation.</p>
<p>And at the same time know that there are things that are true that can't be proven.</p>
<p>Both true and not true, or neither.  they are beyond logic.  before logic.</p>
<p>maybe we just don't have the right equipment to perceive it, like our senses tell us everything we think we know about the world, but only in certain modalities.  we have gear in our head that makes sense of the senses, so to speak, but it can only take us so far when it comes to comprehending the cosmic mystery.</p>
<p>That's what I believe.</p>
