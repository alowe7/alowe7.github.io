        <div class="article-content markdown-body"><p>"A tired dog is a happy dog" is a saying of mine.<br />
I think I made it up<br />
But in any case it's true.</p>
<p>And it's true of boys I think as well. It's something boys and dogs have in common.</p>
<p>And that's something I told my kids, my daughters, is that it's probably best to assume that a boy is like a dog.</p>
<p>He wants to please but he's not that bright.  he can't read your mind and most of the time he's just confused.</p>
<p>Haha.</p>
