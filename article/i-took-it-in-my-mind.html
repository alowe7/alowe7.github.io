<p>I took it in my mind to read something I wrote about this shit</p>
<p>You know you’re born and you have no idea what you’re getting into<br />
And then you grow up a little and think maybe you’re starting to get a handle on it<br />
But nope you’re wrong.</p>
<p>And then life really kicks you in the gut and you think this is it.<br />
this is really it.<br />
This is reality and it sucks and it’s depressing and there is no bottom</p>
<p>but you’re still wrong and you’ll never figure it out because it’s too big and too obvious and it's right next to you.</p>
<p>It’s all around you.  Life is all around you, love is all around you.</p>
<p>but death is all around you too.<br />
it’s the other side of life<br />
the other half.<br />
the opposite which defines the other.<br />
It's the shadow that defines the light, and makes the thing apparent to the human mind.</p>
<p>And the knowledge of death has a generative power, it's mysterious, eternal and universal.<br />
It makes you cherish the brief life you do have, the love we share, how rare and precious it all is.</p>
<p>These are the kind of things Rob and I used to talk about.<br />
But nevermind any of that.</p>
<p>what I want to say is that I always felt very close to you Rob, from the  time you were a little kid playing with your sisters and your cousins.</p>
<p>you couldn't have been happier.  I know because I have been there myself, and you brought me back, you brought me there again, we were all there together.</p>
<p>And over the years as you grew up, we recognized each other.</p>
<p>you were one of us.</p>
<p>we were mostly separated in space and time.  but I can say that I felt as close to you as I have ever felt to anyone.</p>
<p>I still do feel close to you, Rob.  I loved you and I love you still.</p>
<p>but the worst part is that I know you loved me too and now that love has passed from the world and I am the lesser for it as are we all.</p>
<p>But the world is a better place because you were in it Rob, even if only for a little while.</p>
<p>Love you forever!</p>
