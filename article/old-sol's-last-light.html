        <div class="article-content markdown-body"><p>Last night I watched the sun go down<br />
And as old sol’s last light became squished and flattened and finally nothing more than a bright yellow dot disappearing behind the horizon I was overcome with a sense of loss and I was reminded of Anita's passing and I longed to have it — the sun — back and to have her —  Anita — back with me again</p>
<p>Those days of our youth seemed like the day and these days seem like the night.</p>
<p>The cold, dark, lonely night.</p>
<p>Sometimes it’s unbearable.</p>
