        <div class="article-content markdown-body">Math is underrated<br />
It’s abstract and sometimes difficult<br />
Almost always taught poorly<br />
But it is a glistening jewel<br />
Representing a way to think about things and their relationships that is very powerful and useful<br />
There’s so many different areas of mathematics that each have their own characteristics<br />
It’s not linear that one branch necessarily precedes another, only sometimes<br />
I think things like combinatorics and permutations and set theory and maybe even complex analysis should be required for everybody<br />
Within reason of course</div>
