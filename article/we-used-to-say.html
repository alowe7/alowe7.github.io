        <div class="article-content markdown-body"><p>We used to say</p>
<p>One time a friend of mine quipped: every problem can be solved with another level of abstraction.</p>
<p>It’s not true of course and is maybe an example the dry humor one sometimes finds among scientists and engineers.</p>
<p>No not every problem can be solved this way, but some can and many can be grappled with more effectively by developing an abstraction layer, looking for commonalities, sometimes doing something called "factoring" but not with numbers, but rather behaviors or maybe features.  to apply similar techniques across different domains, or observe some sort of meta behavior across a class of entities</p>
<p>So in science we usually operate in three dimensions maybe four if you count time as in relativity</p>
<p>These are the dimensions we can observe at least so we think. But in some theories they postulate 9 or 12 dimensions I’m not sure. They’re pretty far out there and maybe a little dubious at this point like string theory whatever that is</p>
<p>But really I don’t think you have to go that far afield to find evidence of higher dimensionality all around you, even if your brain isn't naturally wired up to recognize them.</p>
<p>Like complex numbers in physics and electrical engineering. We use them to represent physical quantities but they’re basically describing things not in the real plane but in complex space: essentially a real space consisting of the real plane and what is called the imaginary plane orthogonal to it.  in other words, another real plan in another dimension. that's what a dimension is, a measure orthogonal to all others.</p>
<p>These complex numbers help describe the real world even though one component is called imaginary. They just made it up.</p>
<p>Another example might be out in space in the larger structures they’re starting to make out</p>
<p>If gravity deforms the space time continuum then maybe space time can assume more complex topologies like the surface of a Klein bottle or something analogous in higher dimensions.</p>
<p>And in what space would that space itself reside?</p>
